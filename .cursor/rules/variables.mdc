Were using Vite to build the project.
The source files are in TypeScript (.ts), but we want the final output to be plain JavaScript (.js).
All the compiled files go into a folder called dist/.
We re using ES modules, not CommonJS, so everything uses import/export â€” no global variables.
Each file in the src/ folder stays modular, meaning they stay separate instead of being bundled together into one file. This helps keep things clean and easy to import elsewhere.
