Email formatting: 

Table-based layouts with inline CSS - Gmail heavily relies on table structures for consistent rendering
Inline styling required - External stylesheets are not supported; all CSS must be inline
Limited font support - Primarily web-safe fonts (Arial, Helvetica, Google Sans, Roboto)
Responsive design limitations - Uses media queries but with constraints
Image handling - Images must be hosted online and publicly accessible
Content processing - Automatically strips certain HTML elements and JavaScript for security
